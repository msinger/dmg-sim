DMG Sim
=======

SystemVerilog code for simulating a Game Boy system with Icarus Verilog.
Most of the code is derived from the schematics in
[furrtek/DMG-CPU-Inside](https://github.com/furrtek/DMG-CPU-Inside).
The SM83 CPU core is not part of these schematics. I used the schematics in
[gdevic/A-Z80](https://github.com/gdevic/A-Z80) to get an inspiration how the
SM83 core could function internally and implemented it in a similar way.

Usage
-----

There are two main targets in the Makefile:

 * sim-test: Simulates DMG-CPU B chip without a CPU (dmg\_cpu\_b\_test.sv)
 * sim-gameboy: Simulates a complete Game Boy system with CPU (dmg\_cpu\_b\_gameboy.sv)

Make without arguments (or make all) runs both simulations.

Each simulation can produce any of the folowing files (% stands for either *test* or *gameboy*):

| File(s)                       | Description                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ./dmg\_cpu\_b\_%.snd          | The APU's sound output. All four channels mixed into one 16 bit PCM file with 65536 Hz stereo.          |
| ./dmg\_cpu\_b\_%\_ch[1-4].snd | One 8 bit PCM file with 65536 Hz mono for each channel. Only if CH\_DUMP=y is set on make command line. |
| ./dmg\_cpu\_b\_%.vid          | The PPU's video signal dump. Can be used to extract images for a video.                                 |

To produce a playable video file from those dumps, run
```
make dmg_cpu_b_test.mkv
```
or
```
make dmg_cpu_b_gameboy.mkv
```

By default all internal signals are dumped in FST format. To dump in VCD, add `DUMP=vcd` to the make command line. `DUMP=`
disables dumping of internal signals.


Requirements
------------

Of course you need Icarus Verilog and GNU Make.

If you want to generate video files, you also need GCC, ImageMagick and FFmpeg.


Simulate boot ROM
-----------------

The boot ROM is not part of this repo. You need to download it somewhere else (in binary form; 256 bytes).
Put it in the root directory of this repository and rename it to `DMG_ROM.bin`. You can also build and use
the quick boot ROM in the `boot` folder. You need the [SM83 Binutils](https://github.com/msinger/binutils-sm83)
for that. To use it you can either move the generated binary to the root of the repository and rename it
to `DMG_ROM.bin` or add the variable `BOOTROM=boot/quickboot.bin` to the `make` command line.

Then simulate it with:
```
make sim-gameboy
```

This simulates the boot ROM without cartridge. You can specify a ROM file and how many seconds you want to
simulate:
```
make sim-gameboy ROM=path/to/romfile.gb SECS=10.0
```

The simulation takes about 45 minutes per simulated second on a Ryzen 5 3600. If you just want to generate a
video, you can safe some time by disabling the signal dump:
```
make sim-gameboy DUMP=
```

Then create video file with:
```
make dmg_cpu_b_gameboy.mkv
```

This is what the video should look like: [https://youtu.be/kIpV2FVUPKs](https://youtu.be/kIpV2FVUPKs)
